# RealEstate Multi-Modal AI

A learning project designed to explore multi-modal search and recommendation systems, combining text and image embeddings. The project aims to develop a robust AI-based search and recommendation system tailored for real estate applications, focusing on handling both textual descriptions and property images.

## Features

- **Text Embedding Extraction**: Processes property descriptions using pre-trained NLP models.
- **Image Embedding Extraction**: Extracts features from property images using pre-trained vision models.
- **Similarity Search**: Utilizes FAISS for efficient multi-modal similarity search.
- **Modular Design**: Built with extensibility and scalability in mind.
